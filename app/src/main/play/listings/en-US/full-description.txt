ADB Shellkit gives you access to the hidden system commands that came with your phone.

- Works on both rooted and non-rooted devices
- Easy way to access and run system commands such as top, logcat, disk usage, rooted commands, pretty colors and formatted display
- Save output to numerous sharing options (files, mail, google drive, etc)
- Run your own system commands or select one from my library
- User saved commands across devices with configured shell variables 
- A good and growing list of global system commands you can use
- Yes, there are ads, but you can easily turn them off in settings. 

This application is my swiss army knife and testing grounds, so you will often see new commands, tools, etc show up from time to time. 

**UPDATE** I've open-sourced this app, feel free to submit suggestions, feedback, or contribute!  https://github.com/kwattsorg/adbshellkit
